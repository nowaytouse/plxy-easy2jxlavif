# video2mov - Video Repackaging Tool

`video2mov` is a command-line tool designed for video files, aiming to **losslessly repackage** various video formats into the `.mov` container format. This tool does not re-encode video, but instead uses stream copy to ensure that the quality of the original video and audio streams is fully preserved, while providing better compatibility and metadata handling capabilities.

## üöÄ Core Features

- **Lossless Repackaging**: Uses `ffmpeg -c copy` for stream copying, without any re-encoding of video or audio, ensuring original quality.
- **Wide Video Format Support**: Supports common video formats such as `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`, `.wmv`, `.flv`, `.webm`, `.m4v`, `.3gp`, etc.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Uses `exiftool` to completely copy the metadata of the original video file to the new `.mov` file.
- **Accurate File Count Verification**: After repackaging is complete, a detailed file count verification report is provided to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the processing.
- **Safe and Reliable**: Supports a retry mechanism and verifies that the output file exists and is valid before deleting the original file, ensuring the safety of the processing.
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides a comprehensive processing log `video2mov.log`.
