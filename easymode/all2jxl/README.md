# all2jxl - Universal Image to JXL Converter

A powerful command-line tool to convert a wide variety of image formats to JPEG XL (JXL) losslessly.

## üöÄ Features

- **Broad Format Support**: Converts all common static and animated image formats, including JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, HEIC/HEIF, and more.
- **Intelligent HEIC Handling**: Automatically uses the best conversion strategy for HEIC/HEIF files, ensuring maximum compatibility.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Copies all metadata (EXIF, XMP, etc.) from the source image to the new JXL file.
- **Robust Verification**:
    - For lossless sources (like PNG), verifies the conversion with a pixel-perfect check.
    - For tricky formats (like HEIC), uses a simplified verification to ensure the JXL file is valid and decodable.
- **Safe by Default**: Skips conversion if a JXL file of the same name already exists.
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides comprehensive logs of the entire process in `all2jxl.log`.

```bash
# Navigate to the script directory
