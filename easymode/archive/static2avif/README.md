# static2avif - Static Image to AVIF Converter

`static2avif` is a command-line tool designed for image collectors and efficiency seekers, aiming to convert static images (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, HEIC/HEIF, etc.) to the next-generation image format AVIF (.avif) in a high-quality, safe, and reliable manner.

## Core Features

- **Fully Automatic Intelligent Processing:** Without any complex configuration, the tool runs in a unique "fully automatic mode", intelligently identifying each file and adopting the optimal strategy for processing.
- **Visually Lossless Conversion:** Guarantees high-quality conversion, ensuring that your images maintain excellent visual quality during the conversion process.
- **High-Performance Concurrent Processing:** Fully utilizes the multi-core performance of modern CPUs to process multiple files concurrently, significantly reducing waiting time.
- **Safe and Reliable:** Adopts transactional operations and automatically rolls back on failure, ensuring that original files are not affected.
- **Intelligent Error Recovery:** Supports a retry mechanism, so network fluctuations or temporary failures will not cause the entire task to fail.
- **Comprehensive Statistical Reports:** Provides detailed processing logs and statistical information, allowing you to clearly understand the conversion results.
- **Accurate File Count Verification:** After the conversion is complete, a detailed file count verification report is provided to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the processing.
- **Optimized HEIC/HEIF Handling:** Adopts a more stable intermediate format conversion strategy to improve the success rate of HEIC/HEIF file conversion.
- **Code Optimization:** Eliminates duplicate functions and merges duplicate `validateFileCount`, `findTempFiles`, and `cleanupTempFiles` function definitions to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Technical Advantages

### Intelligent Strategy Selection

The tool automatically selects the optimal conversion strategy based on the file type:

- **For JPEG files:**
  - **High-Quality Conversion:** The program uses the `libsvtav1` encoder of `ffmpeg` for conversion.
- **For PNG files:**
  - **High-Quality Conversion:** The program uses the `libsvtav1` encoder of `ffmpeg` for conversion.
- **For BMP/TIFF files:**
  - **High-Quality Conversion:** The program uses the `libsvtav1` encoder of `ffmpeg` for conversion.
- **For HEIC/HEIF files:**
  - **High-Quality Conversion:** The program uses `ImageMagick` to convert to a PNG intermediate file, which is then converted by the `libsvtav1` encoder of `ffmpeg`.

### Advantages of AVIF Format

1. **High Compression Ratio:** The AVIF format has a higher compression ratio than JPEG/PNG, significantly reducing file size while maintaining visual quality.
2. **Modern Feature Support:** Supports modern features such as HDR, wide color gamut, and transparency.
3. **Wide Compatibility:** Modern browsers and devices all support the AVIF format.

## Installation Requirements

### System Dependencies
- Go 1.19 or higher
- FFmpeg 4.0 or higher (for image conversion)
- ImageMagick (for HEIC/HEIF conversion)

### Install FFmpeg
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install ffmpeg imagemagick

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg imagemagick

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install ffmpeg imagemagick
```

## Build the Project

### Method 1: Using go build
```bash
cd /path/to/static2avif
go build -o bin/static2avif main.go
```

## Usage

The executable is located at `bin/static2avif`. For detailed usage, please see [USAGE_TUTORIAL_ZH.md](../USAGE_TUTORIAL_ZH.md).

### Basic Conversion
```bash
# Convert an entire directory
./bin/static2avif -input /path/to/images -output /path/to/avif/output
```

### Advanced Configuration
```bash
# Convert with high-quality settings
./bin/static2avif -input /input -output /output -quality 80 -speed 5

# Specify the number of concurrent threads
./bin/static2avif -input /input -output /output -workers 4

# Skip existing files
./bin/static2avif -input /input -output /output -skip-exist
```

### Command-Line Arguments

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-input` | string | none | Input directory (required) |
| `-output` | string | none | Output directory (required) |
| `-quality` | integer | 50 | AVIF quality (0-100) |
| `-speed` | integer | 6 | Encoding speed (0-10) |
| `-workers` | integer | CPU cores | Number of concurrent worker threads |
| `-skip-exist` | boolean | false | Skip existing files |
| `-dry-run` | boolean | false | Dry run mode |
| `-timeout` | integer | 120 | Timeout in seconds for a single file |
| `-retries` | integer | 2 | Number of retries on failure |
| `-replace` | boolean | false | Delete original files after conversion. **‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Note**: Only deletes original files after verifying that the target file exists and is valid. |

## Log Interpretation

The program will output the processing progress to the console and generate a `static2avif.log` log file in the current directory. The main log messages include:

- `üîÑ ÂºÄÂßãÂ§ÑÁêÜ`: Start processing a file
- `‚úÖ ËΩ¨Êç¢ÂÆåÊàê`: File conversion successful
- `‚ùå ËΩ¨Êç¢Â§±Ë¥•`: File conversion failed
- `‚è≠Ô∏è  Ë∑≥ËøáÂ∑≤Â≠òÂú®ÁöÑÊñá‰ª∂`: Skipped an existing file (when using `-skip-exist`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems

1. **"command not found: ffmpeg"**
   - Make sure FFmpeg is installed correctly and is in the PATH

2. **Slow conversion speed**
   - Lower the speed parameter value (0-3)
   - Reduce the workers parameter value
   - Check system resource usage

### Supported File Formats

- **JPEG**: .jpg, .jpeg
- **PNG**: .png
- **BMP**: .bmp
- **TIFF**: .tiff, .tif
- **HEIC/HEIF**: .heic, .heif
