# Version 2.0.2 Update Notes

## Overview

This update represents an important milestone for the project, including multiple key feature improvements, bug fixes, and test validations. The main goal is to improve system stability, security, and user experience.

## Major Updates

### 1. Modular Validation System

Added comprehensive post-processing validation mechanism, an important security feature:

- **File Count Validation**: Ensures all original files are properly processed
- **File Size Validation**: Checks the reasonableness of converted file sizes
- **EXIF Data Validation**: Verifies metadata is correctly preserved
- **Failure Report Generation**: Automatically generates user-friendly validation reports

### 2. Static/Dynamic Image Separation

Added specialized tools for JXL conversion:

- **static2jxl**: Specifically handles static image to JXL conversion
- **dynamic2jxl**: Specifically handles dynamic image to JXL conversion
- **Independent Optimization**: Each tool is optimized for specific types

### 3. Smart Validation Reports

- **JSON Format Reports**: Easy for programmatic processing
- **Text Format Reports**: Easy for user reading
- **Detailed Analysis**: Includes reason analysis for unprocessed files

### 4. Main Program Optimization

Integrated advanced features:

- **Advanced Scanning Engine**: Two-stage scanning mechanism
- **Smart Strategy**: Selects optimal conversion strategy based on file characteristics
- **Watchdog Monitoring**: Real-time processing status monitoring
- **State Management**: Persistent state storage
- **Security Enhancements**: Multi-layer security checks

## Key Fixes

### File Deletion Bug Fix

Fixed a critical file deletion error:

**Issue Description**: When processing files with the same name but different extensions (e.g., `image.jpg` and `image.jpeg`), the program would incorrectly delete original files.

**Fix Solution**: When skipping existing target files, corresponding original files are no longer deleted, ensuring data safety.

**Scope of Impact**: All easymode tools have been updated with this fix.

## Test Validation

### Emoji Folder Test
- **Test Files**: 31 image files
- **Conversion Result**: All successfully converted to JXL format
- **Original Files**: All safely preserved
- **Validation Status**: ✅ Passed

### Menchazi Folder Test
- **Test Files**: 31 image files
- **Conversion Result**: All successfully converted to JXL format
- **Original Files**: All safely preserved
- **Validation Status**: ✅ Passed
