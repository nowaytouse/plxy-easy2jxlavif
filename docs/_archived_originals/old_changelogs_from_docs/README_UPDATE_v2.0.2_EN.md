# Easy2JXLAVIF Update Notes v2.0.2

## 🎉 Major Updates

This update brings a brand new validation system and static/dynamic image separation processing functionality, significantly improving tool reliability and user experience.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. Modular Validation System
- **Smart Validation**: Automatically validates processing results including file count, size, EXIF data, etc.
- **Failure Reports**: Generates detailed failure analysis reports to help users understand reasons for unprocessed files
- **User-Friendly**: Provides validation reports in both JSON and text formats

### 2. Static/Dynamic Image Separation
- **static2jxl**: Dedicated tool for static image to JXL conversion
- **dynamic2jxl**: Dedicated tool for dynamic image to JXL conversion
- **Independent Tools**: Each tool has independent configuration and optimization

### 3. Unified Fixes
- **Security Fix**: Fixed the issue of incorrectly deleting original files when skipping existing files
- **Consistent Behavior**: All easymode tools now use the same secure logic

## 🔧 Usage

### Static Image to JXL
```bash
cd easymode/static2jxl
go run main.go -input /path/to/images -output /path/to/output -workers 4
```

### Dynamic Image to JXL
```bash
cd easymode/dynamic2jxl
go run main.go -input /path/to/images -output /path/to/output -workers 4
```

### Validate Processing Results
The validation module automatically generates validation reports including:
- `validation_report.json`: Detailed JSON format report
- `validation_report.txt`: User-friendly text report

## 📊 Validation Report Contents

### File Statistics
- Total file count
- Processed file count
- Skipped file count
- Failed file count
- Unprocessed file details

### Size Validation
- Original total size
- Processed total size
- Space saved

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

### Emoji Testing
Use the provided test script to test emoji folders:
```bash
chmod +x test_emoji.sh
./test_emoji.sh
```

### Validation Testing
Check validation reports after processing:
- View `validation_report.txt` to understand processing results
- Check reason analysis for unprocessed files
- Verify compression ratio and EXIF preservation

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Backup Important Data**: Please backup important files before processing
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure necessary conversion tools are installed (cjxl, ffmpeg, etc.)
3. **Monitor Logs**: Pay attention to log output during processing
4. **Validate Results**: Check validation reports after processing

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure cjxl and ffmpeg are installed
2. **Permission Issues**: Check file read/write permissions
3. **Insufficient Space**: Ensure adequate disk space

### Getting Help
- Check log files for detailed error information
- Review failure analysis in validation reports
- Use dry-run mode to test configuration

## 🎯 Future Plans

- More format support
- Batch processing optimization
- Cloud processing support
- GUI version
